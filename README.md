# naturaldisasters

This project is a natural disasters visualization created by Mia Collymore Abbas, Nina Redpath and Amee Rothman. 

the goal of this project is to demonstrate which natural disasters are most prominent in each county, so that someone considering moving to a new county is educated on the risks.

Each file is our code, excluding a few lines which are cited within the code, and the following files are from external sources. 

- DisasterDeclarationsSummaries.json is the natural disaster data that we visualize, taken from FEMA. 
- geojson-counties-fips.json is a datasource that creates county geometries that we can add to the map. it is taken from
- https://github.com/plotly/datasets/blob/master/geojson-counties-fips.json
- StatesData.js is a file that creates state outline geometries. it is taken from Leaflet.io
